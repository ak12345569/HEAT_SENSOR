# Temperature Measurement using AVR Microcontroller
# Features
* Displays OF TEMPRATURE.
* Automatically detect the temperature.
# 4W and 1H
* What - Temperature Measurement circuit to measure the temprature.

* Why - To get to know about electric circuits better.

* When - Whenever needed, one should be able to see the temprature.

* Where - Wherever he is.

* How - By using Atmega32 microcontroller and SimulIDE.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengths

* Real time temprature display.
* limited range

Weakness

* Not able to show negative temprature.
* It's Very common.

Opportunities

* Can add Alarm

Threats

*Can get broken easily.
