# Temperature Measurement using AVR Microcontroller
# ABSTRACT
Temperature measurement in todays industrial environment encompasses a wide variety of needs andapplications. To meet this  wide array of needs the process controls industry has developed a large number of sensors and devices to handle this demand. Temprature is a very critical and widelymeasured variable for most mechanical engineers .
# Introduction
This is an user temprature measurement project developed from zero.The temprature measurement circuit  marks temprature from room temprature to 255 degree ceslcius, using an ATMEGA32 microcontroller. The temprature measurement circuit mark  from room temprature, in the moment that it's powered. To maximum temprature of surrounding. 
# Features
* Displays OF TEMPRATURE.
* Automatically detect the temperature.
# 4W and 1H
* What - Temperature Measurement circuit to measure the temprature.

* Why - To get to know about electric circuits better.

* When - Whenever needed, one should be able to see the temprature.

* Where - Wherever he is.

* How - By using Atmega32 microcontroller and SimulIDE.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengths

* Real time temprature display.
* limited range

Weakness

* Not able to show negative temprature.
It's Very common.

Opportunities

* Can add Alarm

Threats

* Can get broken easily.
